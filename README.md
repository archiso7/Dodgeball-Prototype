# Dodgeball Prototype
This is a small prototype dodgeball game I'm working on. I won't be putting the code here, just the builds of the game.

# How to run the game
Go to the releases page and download the latest release. Once the .zip is downloaded, extract it and open the Dodgeball.exe.

# Controls
Movement -> WASD and Mouse

Dash -> X

Grapple -> V

Pickup -> E

Drop -> Q

Throw -> Mouse 1

Currently only mouse and keyboard are supported
